It's run by consortium of failing private firms including Deloitte, Serco, G4S & Sodexo Reason Johnson calls it ""NHS track & trace"" is so blame for failure can be pinned on our NHS. It's part of long-term plan to undermine the NHS."		"720Retweets

All these companies and more are involved in the test, track and trace system. All of them have an utterly disastrous record. It's time to kick every one of them out of the system. Now. #Dispatches		"610Retweets

And there's no sign of any contract, even. So just what are they doing for the money? opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocra…		"469Retweets
