Twitter	Prem Sikka	published 6 hours ago	http://twitter.com/premnsikka/status/1309132692710141959	@EdConwaySky How much of this £12bn has gone to Serco, G4s, Deloitte, KPMG, PwC, and other hangers-on for delivering little. The Govt could have made GPs the centres for tests as many countries have done so, but it chose to outsource. We still don't have a decent test/trace facility.		"130Retweets
